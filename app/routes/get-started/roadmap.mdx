# Roadmap

We have a lot of plans for Earthstar, and this year our development is being funded by a grant from NLnet and NGI Assure!

## Winter 2021

The first milestone will deliver a complete reworking of Earthstar that is nearing completion. This new version has support for resumable synchronisation (e.g. over intermittent connections), support for multiple JS runtimes (e.g. browsers, Node, Deno), a synchronous cache abstraction for pockets, and a channel-based API for subscribing to pocket events. The major remaining part is implementing synchronisation over a swappable transport (e.g. HTTP, WebSocket, BroadcastChannel).

- Create a first edition of the website containing: an adequate landing page, concept glossary, core API documentation, and specification for the ES5 data format.
- Add RPC-based syncing to support protocol agnostic sync
- Add a HTTP + Server Sent Events sync implementation
- Add a WebSocket sync implementation
- Add a BroadcastChannel sync implementation
- Create a stop-gap pocket server implementation so that we can deploy test infrastructure
- Create a stop-gap implementation of the IndexedDB pocket to save large amounts of data

## Winter 2022

The second milestone focuses on delivering the benefits of the new version of Earthstar (and its future additions within this project) to client authors and end-users, and so that we have a platform to see the effects of our development in the field. This takes the form of a binding library for users of the React library, and an updated version of an existing long-form discussion application.

- Update react-earthstar for Earthstar v2’s new APIs
- Update Letterbox to use the updated version of react-earthstar
- Add identity creation and management UI for Letterbox
- Create a desktop version of Letterbox using [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/)
- Update the website to add react-earthstar API documentation, as well as a prominent download CTA for the Letterbox desktop app.

## Spring 2022

Earthstar promotes the use of small, user-operated ‘pocket servers’ for networks to propagate their data through. In order for this to be a viable approach, we need a pocket server that is trivial to deploy and configure. We also need ways for early adopters of this to support the general Earthstar ecosystem.

- Create a new pocket server implementation with allowlist / blocklist for syncable spaces, data retention policies (e.g. hold trusted spaces’ data indefinitely, hold unknown spaces’ data for an hour)
- Create a new SQLite Pocket implementation for data persistence.
- Add the new SQLite Pocket to the Letterbox app.
- Update the website with a tutorial for setting up a pocket server, and a tutorial for building a chatroom, and API docs for the SQLite pocket.

Obtaining a space’s public key currently grants you read/write access to its contents. In this milestone, an optional private key required for write access will be added. This opens the door to being able to host a space’s data without being able to write to it. Additionally, helpers for encrypting and decrypting the contents of a document will be added.

- Add a ed25519-style keypair for spaces, making it possible to have read-only spaces.
- Add utilities for writing and reading encrypted data to document contents (NB: document metadata will remain unencrypted), possibly using the methodology of private-box (https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/private-box)
- Have an external security quickscan of the new document encryption
- Support for joining these new read-only spaces in the Letterbox app
- Update the website with the new ES6 data specification and any new APIs

## Summer 2022

Finally, we want to add support for large blobs to Earthstar. This would mean support for internally representing a document’s contents as Uint8array, and improved methods for storing this data in different pocket implementations, especially the IndexedDB pocket.

- Add blob support to documents
- Update the pocket implementation to efficiently store binary data
- Create a good implementation of the IndexedDB pocket
- Add an attachments feature to the Letterbox app
- Update the website with the new ES7 data specification and any new APIs
