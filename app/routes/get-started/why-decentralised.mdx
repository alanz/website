# Why is Earthstar decentralised?

With most online services, your data and online identity is stored on a centralised server. You sign in with a username and password, and are issued temporary privileges to access them. This gives the server's owner a lot of power:

- They decide whether the identity you choose is acceptable or not
- They decide what constitutes 'appropriate content'
- They decide which applications you can use
- They give themselves the right to nose through your data
- They are responsible for protecting you from malevolent users (and are usually pretty bad at it)

Earthstar is designed so that data and identities are colocated with the people who use them. This inverts the power dynamic:

- **You** decide how to express your identity
- **You** decide what is appropriate and what is not
- **You** decide which applications you can use
- **Your** data only goes where **you** want it to
- and is only propagated to people **you** trust

The trade is that Earthstar is only useful for forming networks with people you know and trust already â€” but many people consider that a plus.
