# earthstar API

`earthstar` is a reference implementation of written in Typescript. You can use it to add Earthstar functionality to programs running on servers, in browsers, or on the command line.

Because this library can be used in different environments, it has a very modular API that requires many pieces to be plugged together. The upside is this library has a lot of flexibility.

## `Crypto`

Earthstar relies on [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to) cryptography to sign and verify documents.

(set different crypto driver to crypto global, give background)
(generate identity with crypto)

## `StorageAsync`

(create storages with es4 + different drivers, list all of them)

(list all the different methods and what they do, examples - order by utility?)

## `Doc`

## `Query`

(query a storage, explain what the different properties do)

## `Peer`

(Adding storages to a peer, list of different methods)

## `QueryFollower`

(what is this for, lifecycle)

## `StorageCache`

(explain what this is useful for and how it works)
