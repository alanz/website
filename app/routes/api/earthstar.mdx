# earthstar API

`earthstar` is a reference implementation of written in Typescript. You can use it to add Earthstar functionality to programs running on servers, in browsers, or on the command line.

Because this library can be used in different environments, it has a very modular API that requires many pieces to be plugged together. The upside is this library has a lot of flexibility.

Here's the outline of the minimum needed to have an Earthstar application:

(diagram here)

At the top level is a `Peer`, which can contain many `StorageAsync`, which have methods for setting and querying documents (see the `Doc` and `Query` types).

(add syncing description once API has settled)

## `Peer`

(Adding storages to a peer, list of different methods)

## `StorageAsync`

(create storages with es4 + different drivers, list all of them)

(list all the different methods and what they do, examples - order by utility?)

## `Doc`

## `Query`

(query a storage, explain what the different properties do)

## `QueryFollower`

(what is this for, lifecycle)

## `Crypto`

Earthstar relies on [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to) cryptography to sign and verify documents stored in pockets. This

(set different crypto driver to crypto global, give background)
(generate identity with crypto)

## `StorageCache`

(explain what this is useful for and how it works)
