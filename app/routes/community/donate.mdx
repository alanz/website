# Donate

Earthstar is a non-profit project aiming to create a freer, fairer internet. As such it relies on the freely given contributions of volunteers to survive. It's really great when those volunteers can dedicate themselves fully to the project, without having to use their spare time!

This is made possible by donations from people like you, and through our generous grantors that support the project.

The best way to donate is through our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/earthstar).

If you'd like to donate your cryptocurrency:

- Ethereum: `0x037659842470a3dB0C39F0A8bBaDF396b7d15d85`
- Bitcoin: `3L3enx1zhaHFgaC2jRMZi8kF12LT5d2Tsr`
- Filecoin: `f1xmezeu5gvlod6gl4fszc6te4u2jazlvijp5kozq`

For other currencies, please email sam@gwil.garden for the appropriate wallet address.
