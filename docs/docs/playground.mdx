# Playground

You can play with the Earthstar API right here in your browser.

Open your browser's development console and start typing in `Earthstar`. It's been added to the global scope. <Link href={LATEST_DOCS_URL}>You can find full documentation for the API here</Link>.
  
Let's begin by creating an identity. We'll use this to write some data shortly.

```js
let identity = await Earthstar.Crypto.generateAuthorKeypair("suzy");
```

Feel free to change the shortname to whatever you want, as long as it's four lowercase letters or numbers.

We want to write some data, so let's make a replica. A replica is a local copy of a share's data which can synchronise with other replicas.

We should decide on a cool name for our share. You can change it to whatever you like, just make sure it starts with a `+` and that the part after the dot begins with a letter. Lowercase letters and numbers only.

```js
let shareAddress = "+pizza2nite.p34axr";
```

With that settled, we need a storage driver to tell our replica how to save data. As we're just playing around in a console, let's persist everything to memory for now.

```js
let driver = new Earthstar.ReplicaDriverMemory('+myshare.a123');
```

Now to instantiate our replica with the driver we just made:

```js
let replica = new Earthstar.Replica(shareAddress, Earthstar.FormatValidatorEs4, driver);
```

Our replica is ready to go. Let's put some data in it with the identity we made earlier.

```js
replica.set(identity, { content: 'Pizza Margherita!', path: '/my-order.txt', format: 'es.4'});
```

Let's check if it worked.

```js
await replica.getLatestDocs();
```

```

	}
]
```

Great! We should synchronise this to our friends so they know which pizza to order for us. First we'll need to put our replica inside a `Peer`, which is used to manage shares and coordinate with syncers.

```js
let myPeer = new Earthstar.Peer();
```

And we'll add our replica to it.

```js
myPeer.addReplica(replica);
```

Now we have a peer, we can sync it with other peers! We can do this with peers remotely over the network, but for now let's just pretend and sync with a local one.

```js
let otherReplica = new Earthstar.Replica(shareAddress, Earthstar.FormatValidatorEs4, driver);
```

If we run `otherReplica.getLatestDocs`, we'll get an empty array. It doesn't have any documents in it yet. Let's put this replica in another peer so we can change that!

```js
let otherPeer = new Earthstar.Peer();
otherPeer.addReplica(otherReplica);
```

Now that we have our two peers, let's sync them:

```js
myPeer.sync(otherPeer);
```

And now if we ask for documents:

```js
await otherReplica.getLatestDocs();
```

You'll see the document we made from before has synced over.
