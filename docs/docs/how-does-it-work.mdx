# How does Earthstar work?

## Earthstar databases are keyed to public keys

The special identifier each database belongs to is the public address of an assymetric cryptography keypair. Knowledge of the public key grants discovery and read access of a database. Knowledge of the private key grants write access to the database.

## Every change to data is cryptographically signed by authors

In addition to the special database keypair, each user has one (or many) author keypairs. When data is written to an Earthstar database, the write is given a digital signature by both of these keypairs. With this signature Earthstar is able to cryptographically verify that the author is in possession of both keypairs.

## Earthstar syncs peers using a zero knowledge proof

A device may hold many Earthstar databases. When a peers sync with one another, Earthstar determines which databases they have in common without revealing to each other what those database addresses really are.

## Some terminology

The public addresses databases can belong to are called <span className="text-es-purple">Shares</span>.

Because there are many databases for them scattered among many users, we call the databases <span className="text-es-blue">Replicas</span>.

The cryptographically signed values written to replicas are called <span className="text-es-green">Documents</span>.
