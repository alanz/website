# earthstar API tour

## Table of contents

## Introduction

`earthstar` is a reference implementation of Earthstar written in Typescript. You can use it to add Earthstar functionality to programs running on servers, browsers, or the command line.

It can be imported via URL into a browser:

<Pre>
{`<script type="module">
  import * as Earthstar from "https://cdn.earthstar-project.org/js/earthstar.bundle.v${LATEST_EARTHSTAR_VERSION}.js";
</script>`}
</Pre>

Or Deno:

<Pre>
{`import * as Earthstar from "https://deno.land/x/earthstar@v${LATEST_EARTHSTAR_VERSION}/mod.ts";`}
</Pre>


or installed with NPM:

<Pre>
{`npm install earthstar@${LATEST_EARTHSTAR_VERSION}`}
</Pre>

And import what you need for your specific platform:

```typescript
import { Replica } from "earthstar";
import { ReplicaDriverIndexedDB } from "earthstar/browser";
import { ReplicaDriverSqlite } from "earthstar/node";
```

To integrate Earthstar into your program, your application will probably need a single instance of Earthstar's `Peer` class, which holds the replicas for many shares and is able to synchronise them with other peers.

Nearly all of Earthstar's classes can be configured to suit your specific use-case, For example, a `Replica` can be configured to persist data to IndexedDB if you're building a browser app, or Sqlite if you're building a server or command-line tool.

## Peer

<img src="/api-tour/peer.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A peer holding many replicas" />

A `Peer` is responsible for holding many `Replica`s, and offers many ways to access and manage them. A `Peer` can hold one `Replica` for each share.

There is also a `Peer.sync` method which can be passed 'syncable' things such as another `Peer` or a Websocket or HTTP URL to a replica server. The `Peer` will automatically create a new syncer

```typescript
const myPeer = new Peer();

// Add a replica
myPeer.addReplica(myReplica);

// Sync with a local instance of a `Peer`
myPeer.sync(myOtherPeer);
// Sync with a replica server using Websockets
myPeer.sync("wss://our.club/earthstar");

// ... Some time later...

myPeer.stopSyncing();
```

When two peers synchronise with one another, they perform a 'salted handshake' to determine if they have any shares in common without actually revealing what those shares are. Whichever shares they have in common are synced.

## Replica

<img src="/api-tour/replica.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A diagram showing the flow of writing docs with a validator and a driver in a share which then can be queried to bring out the docs again" />

A local replica of a share's documents. Provides operations for querying and setting documents.

```typescript
import { ReplicaAsync, ValidatorEs4, ReplicaDriverMemory } from "earthstar";

// Construct a replica
const myReplica = new Replica(
  // Needs a share address,
  `+myshare.a8puorlpz1`,
  // A document validator,
  ValidatorEs4,
  // And a driver to teach it how to read and write documents
  new ReplicaDriverMemory(`+myshare.a8puorlpz1`)
);

// Query for documents
const txtResults = myReplica.query({
  filter: {
    pathEndsWith: ".txt"
  }
});

// Set a document
await myReplica.set(myKeypair, {
  format: "es.4",
  path: "notes/ink.txt",
  content: "Don't forget to get some new ink."
});

```

<DocLink apiName="Replica"/>

## Replica drivers

<img src="/api-tour/storage-driver.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="Replica drivers control writing and reading docs" />

Earthstar can be used on in browsers, on servers, the command line, or anywhere JavaScript can be run. There's no single way to persist data in all these environments, which is why we made `Replica` able to use different `ReplicaDrivers` suited to the environment its being used in.

Universal drivers:

- `ReplicaDriverMemory` (no persistence)

Web platform drivers:

- `ReplicaDriverLocalReplica`
- `ReplicaDriverIndexedDB`

Deno drivers:

- `ReplicaDriverSqlite`

Node drivers:

- `ReplicaDriverSqlite`

It's possible to create your own replica drivers which conform to `IReplicaDriver`. <DocLink apiName="IReplicaDriver"/>

## Validators

<img src="/api-tour/validator.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="What a validator does" />

Earthstar shares are able to store documents of different formats. But most of the time, you'll want to use the built-in one from this library: `es.4`. As such, Earthstar currenly only offers one format validator: `FormatValidatorEs4`.

Every time a new document is ingested by a `ReplicaAsync` it is checked by a validator.  In the case of `FormatValidatorEs4`, it checks whether a document's signature matches its  author, space address, and content.

It's possible to write your own validator which adheres to `IFormatValidator`. <DocLink apiName="IFormatValidator"/>

## Identity

<img src="/api-tour/identity.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="An image of a crypto key with a face" />

An identity is a keypair containing a public address and a secret. This keypair is used to sign documents whenever they're written. The public address can be freely distributed, but the secret should be, well, secret.

You can generate identities using [Crypto](#crypto).

Note that documents are not *encrypted* (yet), only *signed*.  This means we can verify that the document has not been tampered with on its journey to you, making it possible for syncing to hop across several peers without worrying about them messing with your data.  They can still *read* your data though -- all docs in a space are readable by everyone in the space.

Technically speaking, these are ed25519 keypairs encoded in base32.

<DocLink apiName="AuthorKeypair"/>

## Query

<img src="/api-tour/query.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A graphical representation of a query" />

Used to describe a document query. Used with `ReplicaAsync.query` and `QueryFollower`.

<DocLink apiName="Query"/>

## Doc

<img src="/api-tour/doc.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A grapichal representation of a doc" />

Represents some cryptographically-signed user data. The contents of a `Doc` can only be changed via `ReplicaAsync`. A document cannot be moved from one share to another. 

<DocLink apiName="Doc"/>

## Crypto

<img src="/api-tour/crypto.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A key lock" />

`Crypto` is used internally for signing and verifying documents using [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to). In most cases, you will want to use it to generate new identity keypairs:

```typescript
const keypair = Crypto.generateAuthorKeypair("suzy");

console.log(keypair);
/*
  {
    "address":"@suzy.bv3cclqhvnbn4fwjur7u4nimm4cznbzigqyihlfwi6acck5b4q54q",
    "secret":"bxrishindifrczhm5riqd4mozx4o5htksqthd64yph4rlfs6ej53n"
  }
*/
```

<DocLink apiName="Crypto"/>

## setGlobalCryptoDriver

Because ed25519 is not part of any JS standard library (or WebCrypto API), there are several third-party implementations, some of which are only available for certain runtimes.

To balance compatibility and performance, Earthstar uses [noble/ed25519](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519) by default. This works in browsers, Deno, and Node.

Earthstar exports a `setGlobalCrypto` function to change this:

```typescript
import { setGlobalCryptoDriver, CryptoDriverChloride } from "earthstar";

setGlobalCryptoDriver(CryptoDriverChloride);
```

<DocLink apiName="setGlobalCryptoDriver"/>

## Syncers

<img src="/api-tour/syncer.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A syncer with a peer" />

Most of the time you will want to use the `Peer.sync` convenience method to synchronise with other peers. But if you are building something special — for example a server, or something with Web Workers and [`BroadcastChannel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) — `Syncer` provides a more flexible API which you can use in combination with classes conforming to `earthstar-streaming-rpc`'s `ITransport` type.

```typescript
import * as Rpc from "https://deno.land/x/earthstar_streaming_rpc/mod.ts";

const myPeer = new Peer();

// This syncer will listen for other syncers using the `my_channel` BroadcastChannel.
const broadcastChannelSyncer = new Syncer(
  myPeer,
  (methods) => new Rpc.TransportBroadcastChannel({
    methods,
    deviceId: myPeer.peerId,
    channel: 'my_channel'
  })
);

// Don't forget to close once done!
broadcastChannelSyncer.close();
```

<DocLink apiName="Syncer"/>

## QueryFollower

<img src="/api-tour/query-follower.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A conveyor belt flow with replica and query delivering docs" />

Listens to events from a `Replica`, and if it matches the given query, sends an event to a [`SuperBus`](https://github.com/cinnamon-bun/superbus).

Here's a basic usage:

```typescript
const myMarkdownFollower = new QueryFollower(myReplica, {
  filter: {
    pathEndsWith: ".md",
  },
});

// Print every newly created / updated Markdown doc to the console
myMarkdownFollower.bus.on((event: LiveQueryEvent) => {
  if (event.kind === "success") {
    console.log("A markdown doc was updated or created!");
  }
});

// Start the follower.
myMarkdownFollower.hatch();
```

A `QueryFollower` must always be _hatched_ first. Hatching makes it catch up with all existing documents which match the query, after which it starts listening for new events.

When you're done with a `QueryFollower`, you should close it to stop callbacks from running:

```typescript
myMarkdownFollower.close();
```

<DocLink apiName="IQueryFollower"/>

## ReplicaCache

<img src="/api-tour/replica-cache.svg" class="bg-gray-200 p-4" alt="A folder holding a replica with cached docs" />

`ReplicaAsync` offers a strictly asynchronous interface to a share's contents. Sometimes a synchronous API would make life far easier, and `ReplicaCache` does its best to provide that.

`ReplicaCache` offers a synchronous API for fetching documents by storing queried documents in an internal cache.

When you first query a document, there is no result. But ReplicaCache can be subscribed to for updates, at which point you return to the cache and get an instant result:

```typescript
import { ReplicaCache } from "earthstar";

const cache = new ReplicaCache(myReplica);

const myQuery = { filter: { pathStartsWith: "/about/" } };

let aboutDocs = cache.queryDocs(myQuery); // This will be an empty list.

cache.onCacheUpdated(() => {
  // Trigger a re-querying of the cache!
  aboutDocs = cache.queryDocs(myQuery); // Now there should be something in there.
});
```

`ReplicaCache` has an optional TTL (time-to-live) option which can be provided to its constructor:

```typescript
const cache = new ReplicaCache(myReplica, 2000); // ms, 1000 by default
```

When you fetch an expired result from the cache, ReplicaCache will then return the latest result from its backing replica.
