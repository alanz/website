# What is Earthstar?

Earthstar is a small and resilient distributed storage protocol designed with a strong focus on simplicity, and the social realities of peer-to-peer computing kept in mind.

## Earthstar is an offline-first database

Earthstar stores all data directly on your device, so that reading and writing works even without an internet connection.

## Earthstar is a key-value database which supports author versions

Earthstar databases store arbitrary data, keyed by two pieces of information: a free-form path and a public key identifying the author. So a single path like '/wiki/flowers' may hold revisions by multiple authors.

## Earthstar data is mutable

Earthstar lets you delete or overwrite the data you have created, but no-one else can.

## Earthstar databases can sync

Earthstar databases can by synchronised so that changes from many users and devices can be combined into a reconciled state.

## Earthstar databases are private

Earthstar databases do not announce their presence to the world. Only people who know a special identifier can learn of their existence from another peer and replicate their data.

Write access is restricted by a second identifier, so it's possible to grant read-only access to a database.

## Earthstar works in the browser

The JavaScript implementation of Earthstar has been designed with standard Web APIs and a pluggable architecture which lets it use APIs exclusive to certain environments, one of them being browsers.
