# Try Earthstar in the browser

You can play with the Earthstar API right here in your browser.

Open your browser's development console and start typing in `Earthstar`. It's been added to the global scope. <Link href={LATEST_DOCS_URL}>There is full documentation for the API here</Link>.

Shares are the boundary of discoverability and access in Earthstar. First we will generate a new share keypair.

```js
const shareKeypair = await Earthstar.Crypto.generateShareKeypair("gardening");
```

Now we can instantiate a Replica for this share using this keypair.

```js
const replica = new Earthstar.Replica({ 
	driver: new Earthstar.ReplicaDriverMemory(shareKeypair.shareAddress), 
	shareSecret: shareKeypair.secret
});
```

The driver tells the replica how to persist data. As we're just experimenting here, we will store its data in memory.

Let's write some data to the share. We will need an author keypair first.

```js
const authorKeypair = await Earthstar.Crypto.generateAuthorKeypair("suzy");
```

This keypair will be used to sign any data we write (along with the share keypair we generated a minute ago).

```js
await replica.set(authorKeypair, { text: "Mushrooms everywhere this year.", path: 'notes/2022/mushrooms'});
```

Let's see if it worked.

```js
await replica.getLatestDocs();
```

```json
[
	{
		// todo get real output here
	}
]
```

Great. Let's see what the syncing API is like. First we'll need another replica for the same share. Except we _won't_ provide this one with the secret:

```js
const otherReplica = new Earthstar.Replica({ 
	driver: new Earthstar.ReplicaDriverMemory(shareKeypair.shareAddress),
});
```

To sync the two replicas, we need to add them to two `Peer` instances.

```js
const peer = new Earthstar.Peer();
const otherPeer = new Earthstar.Peer();
```

And add our replicas to them.

```js
peer.addReplica(replica);
otherPeer.addReplica(replica);
```

And we're ready to sync.

```js
peer.sync(otherPeer);
```

If you query the documents from the other replica we just instantiated:

```js
await otherReplica.getLatestDocs();
```

You'll see the document we created a minute ago.
